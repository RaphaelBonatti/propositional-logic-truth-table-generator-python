# propositional-logic-truth-table-generator-python
The goal of this project is to develop a truth table builder and visualizer tool that can help users deepen their understanding of formal logic and evaluate large propositional formulas.

Main features:
- Truth Table Builder:
    - The tool will accept a well-formed logical formula as a string input.
    - It will generate the corresponding logical truth table, effectively automating the evaluation of composite formulas.

- Truth Table Visualizer:
    - The tool will present the generated truth table in a clear, tabular format.
    - This will allow users to easily analyze the logical structure and behavior of the given formula.

Note: This project was tested using Python 3.12.4 on Ubuntu.
